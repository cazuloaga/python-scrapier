### python-scrapier

Scraper tool that works with minimal input and leverages with ChatGPT to extract relevant info.

## Motivation

There are countless ways on how to build webscrapers. Scrapier is the scraper tool we all need to extract relevant data from websites interesting to us and even checks for relevant info to us. I have built countless scrapers, and wanted to find a way to abstract most of the complexity for each scraper built so I created Scrapier. 

## Usage

I am using FastAPI framework to connect to my application and postgres to handle the data. This app is hosted in [heroku.scrapier](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
